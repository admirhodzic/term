VT220-compatible terminal emulator for DOS


If you happen to need a VT220-compatible terminal emulator for your 40 years old DOS PC, this may help :-) .

- DR.C is a COMM driver
- COMM.CPP/H is a driver wrapper for use in the app
- Term.cpp is terminal emulator
- KEYS.DEF is keyboard mapping definition file

All C/CPP files must be statically linked into one executable.
